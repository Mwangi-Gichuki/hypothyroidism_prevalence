# Hypothyroidism Prevalence

Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) is a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of certain crucial hormones.

Hypothyroidism may not cause noticeable symptoms in the early stages. Over time, untreated hypothyroidism can cause a number of health problems, such as obesity, joint pain, infertility and heart disease.

## Project Intro/Objective

Determining the factors that predispose one to getting hypothyroidism. To do this we will come up with a model that can assist doctors predict whether a patient has hypothyroidism when they input the observed and measured symptoms of the patient into the model

### By Michael Gichuki

### Methods Used
* Data understanding to know the unique characteristics of the data set provided
* Data cleaning to remove null values and columns that are not required for the analysis
* Perform EDA
* Perform any necessary feature engineering 
* Check of multicollinearity
* Start building the model
* Cross-validate the model
* Compute RMSE
* Create residual plots for your models, and assess their heteroscedasticity 
* using Bartlettâ€™s test

### Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* Numpy
* sklearn
* math
* statsmodels
* scipy.stats
* seaborn
## Project Description

The Nairobi hospital is looking to determine which of the following factors predisposes one to the likelihood of being diagnosed with Hypothyroidism:

* Age
* Sex
* on_thyroxine
* query_on_thyroxine
* on_antithyroid_medicationthyroid_surgery
* query_hypothyroid
* query_hyperthyroid
* pregnant
* sick
* tumor
* lithium
* goitre
* TSH_measured
* TSH
* T3_measured
* T3
* TT4_measured
* TT4

## Getting Started

A  model that can assist doctors predict whether a patient has hypothyroidism when they input the observed and measured symptoms of the patient into the model.

The following approaches will be used to find the best model for the prediction:

* Random Forest
* Ada Boost
* SVM - Linear, polynomial, rbf and sigmoid
